# Auto-merge Test

This file was created to test the smart auto-merge system.

## Test Status: ðŸ§ª Testing Auto-merge

**Expected Behavior:**
- This commit to main should automatically trigger the auto-merge workflow
- Since there are no conflicts, it should directly merge into release
- The release branch should be updated automatically within ~2-3 minutes

**Test Time:** {{ current_timestamp }}

**What to check:**
1. GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution
2. Release branch should get this file automatically  
3. Workflow should show green checkmark for successful auto-merge

If you see this file on the release branch, the auto-merge system is working! ðŸŽ‰
